	<h1>Question 4:</h1>
Kanzu Code is looking to build a Task Management App that eases the tracking of various
project tasks right from start to finish. Each project has at least one (1) developer and a
Project Manager. The requirement for each project is that each developer creates a project
and submits a list of milestones.
The developer can change the status of the project ( awaiting-start, in-progress, on-hold )
but only the Project Manager can mark a project as complete.
Using PHP, build an API which supports creation of projects and project milestones and
allows Project Managers to mark them as completed.
Create an API that:
A. Allows an engineers to create a project and add a milestone
B. Allows engineers to change the project status except for “completed” status. In
other words, a project with a completed status cannot be changed to another
status.
C. Returns a list of projects assigned to an engineer
D. Can change the engineer assigned to the project
E. Allows the PM to mark a project as completed. Tip: If an engineer is logged-in, they
shouldn’t be able to select the “complete” status
