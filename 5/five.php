<h1>Question 5:</h1><br>
Jaba is a small consultancy company that deals in conducting research on behalf of a
number of NGOs and other private companies.
They design a number of forms that they always give out to their field staff, who then
move with them while collecting data.
They’ve had a number of challenges with this manual approach especially when entering
this data into their system. The process of inputting the data is prone to lots of errors
leading to inaccurate data.
With this pain point, the team at Jaba have contacted Kanzu Code to design for them a
Web-based Electronic Forms Management System (WeFMS) that will help them to:
A. Create online forms in one central place. A form can have as many fields as possible
and each field must have a data type.
B. Allow Jaba field staff members to browse the forms on their devices and collect
data that should be stored in the system.
C. Make it possible for each form entry to have a record/indicator of the staff member
who entered the data/information.
Prior to creating the form, as a Kanzu Code engineer you’ve been tasked to develop a
database design that suits this use case.
Please create and share an Entity-Relationship model (ER model) for this database.
